indemnities.]{.underline}**

You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Platform to obtain timely notice of any additional terms that may apply. Where required by law, we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any material revisions taking effect, which will set out the text of the amended clause of these Terms of Use and the date the changes will come into force. You will then have a further 30 days after such entry into force to cease your use of the Platform. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

In summary, our Privacy Policy explains what Personal Information we collect (e.g. names, email addresses, IP addresses, OAuth tokens, and uploaded AI model data); how and why we use it (e.g. account creation, platform functionality, support, analytics, legal compliance, and, if you opt in, marketing and early access waitlists); who we may share it with (e.g. Supabase, AWS, and Google Analytics); where it may be stored or transferred (primarily in the U.S.); how we protect it (using encryption, IAM, and monitoring); how long we retain it (based on data type and legal need); and how you can access, delete, or control it by contacting our Privacy Officer.

## ***You consent to the collection, use and disclosure in accordance with Our Privacy Policy***---To the extent permitted by applicable law, by using this Platform, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of your Personal Information as set out in our Privacy Policy \[[provide link]{.mark}\].

[\[NTD: Please ensure that the definition used matches the definition in your Privacy Policy.\]]{.mark}

# Your Eligibility to Use this Platform and its Content

## ***You must be legally allowed to use this Platform***---This Platform is intended solely for users who are of the legal age of majority and who reside in a jurisdiction where the content of this Platform is legally permissible. Any use of this Platform by anyone who does not meet those criteria is unauthorized, unlicensed, and will be deemed in violation of these Terms. We do not knowingly permit anyone under the age of 18 to use the Platform.

## ***What we may do***---In our sole discretion, with or without notice to you, we may take actions to protect against such violations, including terminating your Account, deleting or blocking content, or otherwise prohibiting you from using this Platform. 

## ***Whether we do something or not, we have other rights***---Regardless of whether we take action, it does not in any way waive any other legal right or remedy we may have against you.

# Your Account 

## ***Overview of Accounts***---This Platform currently allows user registration, including sign-in via third-party OAuth providers such as Google or GitHub (an "**Account**"). Certain features of the Platform, including uploading and managing encrypted model files, may require participation in a private or limited-access beta program.

## ***Our Privacy Policy applies to your Account's Personal Information---***All Personal Information collected through your Account will be subject to our Privacy Policy \[[provide link]{.mark}\]. This includes the handling of your account credentials, OAuth login data, and any uploaded files or model metadata associated with your Account.

## ***Your Account must be yours***---You must not register or access an Account on behalf of any individual other than yourself, except for legal entities that are not individuals (such as companies, partnerships, or societies), in which case you may not register or access an Account on behalf of that entity unless you are duly authorized to do act for that entity. 

## ***Your Account information must be accurate***---To ensure that your Account is accurate, we require that you (i) provide true, current and complete Account information as requested by us or our agents from time to time, and (ii) promptly notify us of any changes to your Account information. This includes keeping your linked OAuth identity (such as Google or GitHub account details) accurate and current.

## ***You must keep your Account safe***---We may assign you, or you may create a password and Account identification (e.g. OAuth token) to access and use certain portions of this Platform. While we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard Personal Information as set out in our Privacy Policy, you are solely responsible for ensuring that the access credentials to your Account remain secure and confidential and for verifying and monitoring any activity on your Account. If you use a third-party OAuth provider, you are responsible for securing that account, as unauthorized access to your OAuth account may allow access to your Account.

## ***Anything done through your Account is done by you***---We will assume that any activity on your Account or use of your Account credentials is authorized and directed by you. You will be legally responsible for all activities that occur on your Account, even if the activity is done without your permission. We have no obligation to investigate the authorization or source of any access or use of this Platform that purports to be you, such as activity through your Account. Baseweight is not responsible for unauthorized access due to the compromise of your OAuth provider account.

## ***Please keep us informed if something goes wrong***---You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account or a breach of security with respect to your Account, any password, or any service provided through it. You must also provide reasonable assistance to us, as requested, to stop or remedy those occurrences. Contact procedures are set out in these Terms, in our Privacy Policy \[[provide link]{.mark}\] and on this Platform.

## ***Third-party links are your (and those third parties') responsibility***---You may link or create an Account using a third‑party OAuth identity provider such as Google or GitHub. Authentication data we receive from those providers is handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the third-party's privacy or security practices.

# Rights related to Our Content and Your Content

## ***What "Content" means***---In these Terms, "**Content**" means all materials and content available on or through this Platform. This includes designs, editorial, text, graphics, audiovisual materials, multimedia elements, photographs, videos, music, sound recordings, reports, documents, software, information, formulae, patterns, data and any other work. In terms of Our Content, this also includes source code, processes, designs, technologies, URLs, domain names, trademarks and logos forming any part of this Platform. Any of your Content that includes Personal Information (as defined below) is also subject to our Privacy Policy, and in the event of any contradiction between these Terms and our Privacy Policy \[[provide link]{.mark}\] with respect to Personal Information, our Privacy Policy will prevail.

## ***You have no rights in Our Content***---Except where expressly stated otherwise, all right, title and interest in and to this Platform and all Content that you did not provide yourself ("**Our Content**") fully belongs to us. Our Content is protected by applicable copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or other proprietary rights or intellectual property laws and is licensed subject fully to these Terms.

## ***We do not control Third-Party Content***---This Platform may link to or otherwise make available Content from third parties (collectively, "**Third-Party Content**"). That Third-Party Content is theirs and not yours, and may be governed by terms and conditions applicable to Third-Party Content. Nothing in your use of this Platform grants you any right, title or interest in, or ownership over Third-Party Content.

## ***Your Content is yours***---If you upload AI model files, metadata or filenames through the Platform, those remain your Content, and we do not claim ownership over them. Your Content includes Content that you post, upload, input, provide, submit or otherwise transfer to us or any third-party while using this Platform ("**Your Content**").

## ***We may use Your Content, and Your Content is prohibited unless we are allowed to use it***---While we have the right to use Your Content, we have no obligation to monitor Your Content regardless of any context or disclaimers you provide in connection with Your Content. If you make Your Content available in any way through this Platform, we deem that to mean that you:

### give us a royalty-free, fully paid-up (meaning we have no obligation to pay you), non-exclusive (meaning you may give it to others), irrevocable and perpetual (meaning that you may not terminate it, which we will explain below), license that is without any territorial or geographic limitation (a "**Full License**") to use, copy, transmit, decrypt, deliver, manage, and store ("**Use**") Your Content (including encrypted model files) to the extent we reasonably determine it is necessary for us to operate, support, and improve the Platform as it may exist in any medium from time to time, including enabling features such as secure model deployment, format conversion, and version control;

### give us a Full License to Use Your Content in order to ensure adherence to, or enforce, these Terms, or to comply with any applicable law;

## ***Deleting Your Content***---You may delete Your Content either through this Platform or by deleting Your Account. However, you acknowledge and agree that, because your Full License is irrevocable and perpetual, we may retain copies of Your Content as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://baseweight.ai/privacy). You may always contact us regarding Your Content as set out in these Terms, this Platform or our [Privacy Policy](https://baseweight.ai/privacy). 

## ***If you give us feedback, we have the right to use it**---*If you provide to us any comments, ideas, suggestions or impressions of this Platform or our products and services (collectively, the "**Feedback**"), you give us a Full License to use it for any purpose (in accordance with privacy laws), regardless of whether we actively solicited the Feedback or not.

## ***We are only responsible for Our Content***---You are exclusively responsible for determining the accuracy, suitability, harmfulness or legality of Your Content, even if you did not create it. We do not have any obligation to monitor, censor or review any of Your Content or any Third-Party Content, or to monitor use of this Platform. If we do decide, in our sole discretion, to review or take any action with Content other than Our Content, we have no obligation to take action in the future. 

## ***We may take action if we receive complaints***---If we receive a complaint relating to your use of this Platform, including as it relates to Your Content or your use of Third-Party Content, we may, in our sole and absolute discretion and without notice or liability, investigate the complaint, and censor, alter or remove Your Content, or take any other action that is permitted by applicable law or these Terms. Nothing we do (or fail to do) waives or limits any rights or remedies that we have.
