### Information Gathered

We may collect, store, use and transfer different kinds of Personal
Information about you, as described below:

**[Registration and Early-Access Information]**. You provide
your name, email address, and (where you choose OAuth) the OAuth

up for early access or join the waitlist via our website forms to
contact you about product availability, beta program invitations, or
Baseweight announcements.

**[Contact Form Submissions.]** If you use the "Contact
- Get in Touch" form on our website, we collect your name, email
address, subject line, and any message you submit in order to address
and/or respond to your inquiry.

**[Log Data and Activity Tracking]**: We collect certain
information automatically from visitors and Users of the Platform, such
as such as IP address, approximate geolocation (derived from IP), device
type and operating system, browser type and version, referral source,

 We may collect certain technical information, such as your viewing
time, Mobile App navigation and features utilized, device type,
operating system and version, unique device identifier, browser type and
version, and Mobile App version.

**[Analytics Tools:]**  The Mobile App integrates with
Google Firebase (SDK) in order to capture analytics that enable us to
assess how the Mobile App is interacted with, if and how certain
features are being used, and to collate usage statistics such as daily
and monthly active users and average Mobile App session lengths.

**[Cookies]**. We collect session cookies to keep you logged
in, first-party cookies set by our web application to maintain session
state, and first-party analytics cookies, web beacons, and pixels
provided by Google Analytics for performance analytics.

context of providing the Platform, which may include login data, browser
type and version, location, operating system, and similar information,
as well as User content uploaded to or created on the Platform, and any
Personal Information inadvertently provided to Baseweight through use of
the Platform. This includes AI model files (e.g. ONNX or GGUF),
filenames, or metadata you supply, or optional feedback, bug reports, or
support messages you submit.

**[Marketing and Communications]**: We collect, store, and
process information that you provide to us when you communicate with us,
including when you email or call us. We also store and process your

our Platform, for lawful purposes. For example, we may aggregate data to
calculate the percentage of Users accessing speciﬁc Platform features.
As noted above, this type of data is not considered "Personal
Information" subject to privacy laws because it cannot be used to
identify a particular person.

We avoid collecting any of the following sensitive categories of
Personal Information about you: information regarding your race or
ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual
orientation, political opinions, health, genetic or biometric data.

## How We Share Your Data

### Sharing of Information

> Baseweight will not copy, distribute, or otherwise share any User or
> visitor Personal Information except as set out in this Privacy Policy.
> Baseweight may share or communicate Users' and visitors' Personal
> Information in the following ways:

- **[Within the Organization]**: Within Baseweight, your
  Personal Information may be accessible to personnel with a need to
  know the information in order to perform their duties. At the date of
  this policy, that is limited to (i) the founder/CEO/CTO/Privacy
  Officer and (ii) one Toronto-based co-founder who has access only to
  limited business contact information.

- **[Third-party service providers:]** Baseweight may
  partner with other parties to provide Users with speciﬁc services such
  as Supabase (authentication and metadata database); Amazon Web
  Services (S3 and CloudFront) (encrypted file storage and delivery),
  and Google Analytics (aggregated website analytics). Each is bound by
  contractual confidentiality and security obligations.

- **[App Store Analytics:]** Baseweight uses
  App Store Connect and Google Play Console to distribute the Mobile App
  on the iOS and Android platforms, respectively. Data in connection
  with downloads, source countries, crash analytics, devices and
  operating system versions are collected and shared with Apple and
  Google upon download of the Mobile App from the Apple App Store or
  Google Play Store.

- **[Potential acquirers of Baseweight's business:]** If
  Baseweight is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale (each a
  "transaction"), some or all Baseweight Users' and visitors' Personal
  Information may be disclosed or communicated to evaluate or carry out
  the transaction. In such a case, the other party will be instructed to
  handle the Personal Information in the same manner as provided in this
  Privacy Policy, and Users or visitors will be notified to the extent
  required by applicable laws.

  communication is made.

- **[Consent:]** We may disclose or communicate Users' and
  visitors' Personal Information with third parties where we have
  consent to do so, except as otherwise prohibited by law.

### Data Location and Data Transfers

> Although the Platform enables on‑device inference without cloud
> dependencies or data transfers, Baseweight is headquartered in British
> Columbia and uses cloud infrastructure located in the United States
> (e.g. Supabase, Amazon Web Services, Google Analytics). Accordingly,
> certain Personal Information may be transferred to and processed in
> the United States and may be accessible to U.S. courts, law
> enforcement and national security authorities. If you have questions
> about our cross-border practices, contact the Privacy Officer at
> privacy@baseweight.ai.

## How We Protect and Manage Your Data

### Security

> Baseweight uses appropriate administrative, technical, organizational,
> and physical security measures to protect our Users' and visitors'
> Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
> alteration, and unauthorized disclosure, communication and access. We
> encrypt all model files in AWS S3 at rest, use TLS for all in-transit
> data, and environment segregation (staging vs production), and
> restrict infrastructure access through IAM policies and multi-factor
> authentication. We further monitor infrastructure logs and Google
> Analytics for anomaly detection.
>
> We have procedures in place to address any suspected personal data
> breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach as
> required by law.

### Data Retention

> We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an
> ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you
> with the Platform's services you have requested, to comply with
> applicable legal, contractual, tax or accounting requirements, or to
> defend ourselves from possible legal actions). When we have no ongoing
> legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will
> destroy it or anonymize it in accordance with applicable laws.
>
> We retain account data until you delete your account, uploaded model
> files and metadata until you delete them or your account, server logs
> for up to 12 months, Google Analytics data for 14 months, and
> temporary decryption keys only in memory for the duration of the
> session, after which they are destroyed. When data is no longer
> required, we delete it from Supabase and AWS S3 using secure deletion
> commands and lifecycle rules.
