## A New Chapter for Baseweight

After extensive experience building OnDevice AI infrastructure and tools, Baseweight is now pivoting to focus on what we do best: **providing expert mobile AI services and consulting**.

## Why Mobile AI Services?

The mobile AI landscape has evolved rapidly, but many companies still struggle with:

- **Complex Implementation**: Integrating AI models into mobile apps requires deep expertise in Core ML, TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, and custom inference engines
- **Performance Optimization**: Mobile hardware constraints demand specialized knowledge of quantization, pruning, and platform-specific optimizations
- **Privacy & Security**: OnDevice processing requires careful consideration of model protection and user privacy
- **Cross-Platform Challenges**: Different frameworks and optimization strategies for iOS vs Android

## Our Expertise

With our background in mobile development (PhoneGap/Apache Cordova) and extensive OnDevice AI experience, we're uniquely positioned to help companies:

### Mobile AI Implementation
- Custom AI integration for iOS and Android apps
- Core ML, TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, and Executorch implementations
- Real-time inference optimization for mobile hardware

### Model Optimization
