## Baseweight's Evolution: From Platform to Services

After building comprehensive infrastructure for secure, cross-platform AI deployment—supporting encrypted GGUF and ONNX models on Android and iOS, including early integrations with Executorch and llama.cpp—we've learned what the market really needs.

## The Market Reality

While we built powerful tools for OnDevice AI deployment, we discovered that most companies need **expert guidance and implementation services** more than they need another platform. The technical challenges of mobile AI integration are significant:

- Complex framework integrations (Core ML, TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime)
- Performance optimization for mobile hardware constraints
- Model quantization and pruning for mobile deployment
- Cross-platform implementation challenges
- Privacy and security considerations

## Our New Focus: Mobile AI Services & Consulting

Instead of continuing to build platform tools, we're now focused on what we do best: **providing expert mobile AI services and consulting**.

### What We Offer

- **Mobile AI Implementation**: Custom integration of AI models into iOS and Android apps
- **Model Optimization**: Performance tuning for mobile hardware constraints
- **Custom Solutions**: Tailored AI features for computer vision, NLP, and multimodal applications
- **Technical Consulting**: Strategic guidance on mobile AI architecture and implementation

### Our Expertise

With our background in mobile development (PhoneGap/Apache Cordova) and extensive OnDevice AI experience, we bring:
- Deep knowledge of mobile AI frameworks and optimization techniques
- Experience with real-world mobile AI implementations
- Understanding of privacy and security requirements for OnDevice processing
- Cross-platform development expertise
