As of June 2025, Baseweight is paused.

Over the past year, we built infrastructure for secure, cross-platform AI deployment—supporting encrypted GGUF and ONNX models on Android and iOS, including early integrations with Executorch and llama.cpp. We later extended our efforts into Visual Language Models (VLMs), exploring commercial applications in video indexing and media search.

The tech worked. The timing didn’t.

The market for secure, on-device AI tooling remains early. VLMs show promise, but commercial demand is lagging behind the hype. Rather than continue burning runway into headwinds, we're pausing active development and shifting focus to more sustainable opportunities.

We may return to Baseweight—or its underlying technologies—if the market catches up.

If you’re building in on-device AI, VLMs, or edge inference and want to collaborate, feel free to contact us via the contact form.
